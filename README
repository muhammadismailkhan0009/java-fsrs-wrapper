# java-fsrs-wrapper

Java wrapper for the FSRS spaced-repetition scheduler. It uses ts-fsrs(#https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs). 
Runs on **any Java 17+** using embedded GraalJS — **no GraalVM install required**.

This is hobby project for personal use. The intention is to keep it up-to-date with ts-fsrs library.
